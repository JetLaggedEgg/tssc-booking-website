			The Trimley Sports &#38; Social Club (formally the Port Of Felixstowe Sports and Social Club) offers a warm welcome and a wide range of facilities for members of all ages and their families. The club’s premises consist of a members bar, a function hall for hire, squash/tennis courts, patio area, children’s play area and football pitch.
			<br /><br />
			Membership to the club also gives you access to our two squash courts. Bookings are available in hour slots on the hour or quarter past from 10am till 9:15pm with payment by token at a price of £3 for 30 minutes.
			<br /><br />
			<img id="barImage" src="server/images/barImage.jpg" alt="Main Bar"></img>We are a family club, affiliated to the Pub Watch scheme and we like to think that we combine a pub atmosphere with the benefits of club prices. I'm not slamming the keyboard.
			<br /><br />
			The Club is situated in the village of Trimley St Martin on the High Road with easy access to the A14 and regular bus services to Felixstowe and Ipswich only a minutes walk away.
			<br /><br />
			Here on our website, you’ll find all the information you need about the club, and what we can offer.
			<br /><br />
			If you require any more information then please give us a call or send us an email.
