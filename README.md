# A2 IT - TSSC Project

###### What is it?

	+ This project was my A2 IT project assignment in Sixth Form.
	+ It is a website with a member login system and a booking system too.
	+ It is coded in HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.

###### Where can I access it?

Please note the following before doing so

	+ It is not an active booking system.
	+ Although registered users are saved into an encrypted and secure database, it is not as secure as it should be.
	+ I encourage you to not use your own password of you register.
	+ It is not 100% complete! Please expect bugs.
	+ It is hosted on my home server and therefore may not be live at time of reading.
